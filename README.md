# Blockchain

This Program is used to help me understand Blockchain Technology. I'll implement a simple Blockchain with a Frontend Interface using Flask.

To-Do:

- [ ] Implement a Block Class ("storage" for transactions, information about sender & receipiant)
- [ ] Implement a Linked List to handle the Blockchain (create new Block, validate chain, encrypt, decrypt, ...)
- [ ] Implement a Logic to add "Personalized Wallets" (create a user account, generate unique id,...)
- [ ] Implement a Logic to Handle Transactions (create, add, buy, sell, verify, ...)
- [ ] Implement a Logic to Handle Wallets (create, delete, verify, pause, continue, ...)
